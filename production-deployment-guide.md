## üí∞ Cost Analysis & Optimization

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (AWS - 10,000 Active Users)

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost | Optimization |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **EC2 (API Servers)** | 3x t3.large (2 vCPU, 8GB) | $180 | Use Spot instances for 70% savings |
| **RDS PostgreSQL** | db.r6g.xlarge + Read Replica | $450 | Reserved instances save 30% |
| **ElastiCache Redis** | cache.m6g.large (2 nodes) | $140 | Use smaller instance if < 5k users |
| **Load Balancer** | Application Load Balancer | $25 | Essential, no optimization |
| **S3 Storage** | 500GB for game data | $12 | Lifecycle policies for old data |
| **CloudFront CDN** | 1TB transfer | $85 | Compress assets, cache aggressively |
| **EC2 (Stockfish)** | 4x c5.large (compute optimized) | $240 | Use Lambda for on-demand analysis |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch + X-Ray | $50 | Sample traces to reduce cost |
| **Backup Storage** | 1TB snapshots | $50 | Incremental backups only |
| **Data Transfer** | 2TB outbound | $180 | WebSocket optimization crucial |
| **Container Registry** | ECR for Docker images | $10 | Clean old images regularly |
| **Secrets Manager** | For credentials | $10 | Group secrets to reduce cost |
| **Total** | | **$1,432/month** | **$858/month optimized** |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### 1. **Infrastructure Optimization** (Save 40%)
```yaml
# Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
ec2_spot_config:
  instance_types: ["t3.large", "t3a.large", "t2.large"]
  max_price: 0.0464  # 70% of on-demand price
  interruption_behavior: "stop"
  
# Reserved Instances for database
rds_reserved:
  term: "1-year"
  payment: "all-upfront"
  savings: "30%"
```

#### 2. **Serverless Architecture** (Save 60% on compute)
```typescript
// Migrate Stockfish analysis to Lambda
export const analyzePosition = async (event: APIGatewayEvent) => {
  const { fen } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  
  // Lambda runs Stockfish in container
  const analysis = await runStockfishAnalysis(fen);
  
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(analysis),
  };
};
// Cost: $0.0000166667 per request vs $0.001 on EC2
```

#### 3. **Smart Caching** (Save 30% on database)
```typescript
// Cache expensive queries aggressively
const getLeaderboard = async () => {
  return cache.get('leaderboard:global', 
    async () => {
      // Expensive aggregation query
      return prisma.$queryRaw`...`;
    },
    { ttl: 3600 } // 1 hour cache
  );
};
```

#### 4. **WebSocket Optimization** (Save 50% on data transfer)
```typescript
// Binary protocol for moves (10x smaller than JSON)
const encodeMoive = (move: Move): Uint8Array => {
  // from: 6 bits, to: 6 bits, piece: 3 bits, flags: 1 bit
  // Total: 2 bytes instead of 20+ bytes JSON
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(2);
  const view = new DataView(buffer);
  
  view.setUint16(0, 
    (move.from << 10) | 
    (move.to << 4) | 
    (move.piece << 1) | 
    move.flags
  );
  
  return new Uint8Array(buffer);
};
```

### Scaling Cost Projections

| Users | Infrastructure | Optimized | Per User |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 1,000 | $400/mo | $240/mo | $0.24 |
| 10,000 | $1,432/mo | $858/mo | $0.09 |
| 50,000 | $5,200/mo | $3,120/mo | $0.06 |
| 100,000 | $9,500/mo | $5,700/mo | $0.06 |

## üéÅ Final Recommendations

### Phase 1 (Launch - 1,000 users)
- Start with monolithic deployment
- Use managed services (RDS, ElastiCache)
- Focus on core features stability
- **Budget**: $400/month

### Phase 2 (Growth - 10,000 users)
- Implement caching layer
- Add read replicas
- Optimize queries
- **Budget**: $858/month

### Phase 3 (Scale - 50,000+ users)
- Migrate to microservices
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced analytics with data warehouse
- **Budget**: $3,120/month

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Performance**: Sub-50ms move latency is non-negotiable
2. **Reliability**: Users expect 24/7 availability
3. **Learning**: AI recommendations must improve retention
4. **Cost**: Keep per-user cost under $0.10/month
5. **Security**: Chess games contain learning patterns - protect user data
